# Project objectives 
## Introduction
In this project, the complexity of these tasks, especially is data cleaning section, will require you to use Python with panads, matplot and seaborn, rather than SQL.

The company has high hopes put into the possibilities that come with Data Analysis, and they are especially hopeful that our work can finally settle an ongoing debate: whether or not it’s beneficial to discount products.

* The Marketing Team Lead is convinced that offering discounts is beneficial in the long run. She believes discounts improve customer acquisition, satisfaction and retention, and allows the company to grow.

*  The main investors in the Board are worried about offering aggressive discounts. They have pointed out how the company’s recent quarterly results showed an increase in number of orders, but a decrease in the total revenue. They prefer that the company positions itself in the quality segment, rather than competing to offer the lowest prices in the market.

This is what management asked.

* How big are the offered discounts as a percentage of the product prices.
* How seasonality and special dates (Christmas, Black Friday) affect sales.
* How could data collection be improved.
